POD BLUEPRINTS	

	Deployment
		Abstraction on top of pods, which makes it more convinient to interate with pods, replicate and so on
		In practice, you'll be working with deployments, not with pods
		scaleup-scaledown replicas
		DB CAN'T BE REPLICATED VIA DEPLOYMENT
			because database has state
			Data insonsistences
	STATEFULSET
		for stateful apps or (databases)
			mongodb
			eslasticsearch
	 		postgreSQ
			etc.
		Deploying statefulset not easy !!!
		coomon practice is *Databases  are often hosted outside k8s cluster

Node
	Space where pod is deployed
